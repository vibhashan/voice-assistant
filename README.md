# Description
This is a simple Python GUI Voice Assistant application built with Tkinter library. It makes use of other libraries like "SpeechRecognition, PyAudio and pyttsx3
" to facilitate speech-to-text conversion and vice versa. It further uses a YouTube API for playing videos in Youtube when prompted. This application can perform basic commands like playing a video in YouTube and opening Wikipedia for example. It can further perform very basic communication. Examples of prompts are given below for your reference.

# ðŸ”¥ Getting Started
1. Download or clone the repository using "git clone https://github.com/vibhashan/voice-assistant.git".
2. Navigate to "voice-assistant/Voice Assistant" and install the following Python modules if necessary:
  - PyAudio
  - pyttsx3
  - SpeechRecognition
3. Navigate to "voice-assistant/Voice Assistant" and run "Interface.py" file to start the GUI application with a welcome note.
4. Click on the button with a picture of a mic to allow the application to listen for a command.

# âœŒ Useful Tips
1. When prompting a command, make sure the command is not interrupted by any background noises.
2. The terminal displays "SAY SOMETHING..." once the button is clicked. Give a prompt once this message is displayed.
3. The terminal displays "CONVERTING..." during the conversion process from speech-to-text.
4. The terminal will dispay " 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower' " or any other message if the application is unable to process your input. In this case, you can try again.
5. When the application processes the input command, it is converted to text and displayed in the GUI. This allows you to see whether a valid/correct input is prompted. Based on this converted text, the application performs the action.
